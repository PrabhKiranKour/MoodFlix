Project: Mood-Based Movie Recommendation Agent
Project Overview
This project detects a user's mood through their text input and recommends movies that match that mood. It uses machine learning for sentiment/emotion analysis and integrates a movie info API to supply links and details about recommended films. All code is in Python.

What You Need To Do
Obtain an API key for a movie database, such as OMDb API (free, easy, returns movie links/posters) or TMDb API.

No additional system installations described—keep everything Python standard libraries plus pip-installable packages like requests and transformers.

Step-by-Step Instructions
1. Get a Movie API Key
Register for a free API key at OMDb API or TMDb.

Keep this key ready; it’s required to fetch movie details and poster links.

2. Prepare the Emotion Detection Logic
Use a lightweight, pre-trained emotion/sentiment analysis model.

For best results, use a model from the transformers library (pip install transformers torch), e.g., nateraw/bert-base-uncased-emotion or HuggingFace’s text classification pipeline.

Accept a short text input from the user describing their mood ("I feel happy," "I'm bored," etc.).

Feed the text to your classifier; extract the predicted emotion label (e.g., joy, sadness, anger, fear, neutral).

3. Map Emotions to Movie Genres
Create a mapping between detected emotions and movie genres. Example:

Joy/Love → Comedy, Romance, Family

Sadness → Drama, Animation, Biography

Anger → Comedy, Adventure

Fear → Family, Fantasy

Surprise → Mystery, Adventure, Thriller

Neutral → User’s choice or trending

Store this mapping as a Python dictionary in main.py or recommender.py.

4. Recommend Movies
Based on the detected emotion, pick the corresponding genre(s).

Use the movie API to fetch movies in these genres (with keywords like "genre=comedy" or using API genre endpoints).

Retrieve movie title, year, and a link/poster to display or forward.

Provide at least three suggestions per request.

If the API rate-limits, use movies.csv as a fallback (store movie title, genre, and a sample link).

5. Output and API Usage
Display the recommended movies with basic info and links.

Example output:

Movie: "Finding Nemo" (2003) — [Poster URL] — [OMDb link]

If integrating in a chatbot/agent, return formatted result (dictionary or JSON).

Example main.py Flow
python
from emotion_model import detect_emotion
from recommender import recommend_movies

user_input = input("Describe your current mood: ")
emotion = detect_emotion(user_input)
suggestions = recommend_movies(emotion)
for m in suggestions:
    print(f"{m['title']} ({m['year']}): {m['link']}")



Testing and Safety
Test inputs for all major emotions and ensure the recommendations make sense.

If emotion detection confidence is low, prompt for more input or select a default (e.g., trending movies).
